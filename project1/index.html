                <h2>EDUARDO HUERTA-MERCADO</h2>
                <p>Hi!
                    I am Eduardo Huerta-Mercado. Let me tell you a bit about myself. I was born and raised 
                    in Lima, Peru. Currently, I am a fourth-year EECS student at the University of California, 
                    Berkeley, with a minor in Data Science. I've founded an NGO called UTK United Technologies for 
                    Kids and a Berkeley student organization, INvent, which promotes STEM education in 
                    underprivileged communities and developing countries. So far, UTK has inspired more than 
                    10,000 kids in eleven countries.
                    This summer, I interned at Salesforce - Tableau as a software engineer, where I worked 
                    in the Metrics team to develop a new feature that compares a KPI with historical data for 
                    the mobile and desktop versions. As a result, Tableau users can now author metrics with 
                    historical comparisons on mobile and server.</p>

                <p>Front-end web development is an exciting career because it's always evolving and 
                    constantly changing. This means I'll always have the opportunity to interact with 
                    new tools and learn new skills, keeping me engaged in my career. It's a field that 
                    provides many opportunities for hands-on learning.</p>

                <h1 class="headings">UI/UX <br> Design</h1>
                <p>Design is interactive. When we receive a new project or interact with a first-time 
                    client, we get to learn more about their industry, business, and audience. Design 
                    fosters connection through these interactions and the different kinds of clients we 
                    encounter each and every day.</p>

                <p>In short, a product manager's job is all about solving problems for people. 
                    My projects had led me to develop skills such as creative thinking, problem-solving, 
                    and curiosity, it's quite possible product management is the perfect career choice and I'd be a 
                    perfect fit for a role where I can practice, learn and grow a ton</p>
